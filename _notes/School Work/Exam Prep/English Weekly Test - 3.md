### [[The Palindrome]]

The chapter tells the story of Tenali Raman, a clever but mischievous boy from a South Indian village. After villagers complained about his behaviour, his mother sent him to study with a holy teacher. Excelling in his lessons, Raman was eventually sent to seek his fortune. The teacher gave him a mantra to chant three million times at a temple to receive guidance from a goddess. When the goddess appeared, Raman laughed, joking about how she managed her thousand noses during a cold. Insulted, the goddess cursed him to become a jester, which Raman accepted humorously, noting the word "vikatakavi" is a palindrome.

### [[The Microscope]]

The poem narrates the story of Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch tradesman who invented the microscope. Instead of focusing on his store, Anton dedicated himself to crafting lenses and exploring the microscopic world. He observed fascinating details, such as microorganisms in water, which astonished and confused his peers. Despite being ridiculed and called crazy by his fellow townsfolk, Anton's work revolutionized the understanding of the unseen world and marked a significant breakthrough in science.
