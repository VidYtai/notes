#### Dwarf Planets and Plutoids
The International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines a dwarf planet as a celestial body in direct orbit of the sun. It fulfils the following criteria:
- It is in orbit around the sun
- It has sufficient mass for its self gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium shape.
- It has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.
- It is not a satellite of a planet or other non-stellar body.
